This repo is intended to demonstrate the usefulness of thorough commit messages,
as well as the antagonism of potentially unhelpful commit messages.

* Your Task
As an exercise for the reader, I invite you to checkout the two branches provide and attempt to finish the user stories
provided, using only the information available in your commit messages and status/diffs. Consider tickets/tasks undiscoverable - that is,
you may only access the information in a ticket if the ticket number is provided to you -- otherwise, consider the information lost in 
morass of JIRA.

- Helpful commits: `helpful-commit-message-path`
- Unhelpful commits: `unhelpful-commit-messages`
